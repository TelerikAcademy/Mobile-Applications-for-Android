# Java Overview
##  What is Java?

# Java Overview

- Java is a general-purpose computer programming language
  - One of the most popular programming languages
    - Used for web, desktop and mobile
    - One of the first "pupular" OOP languages
  - Java is object-oriented language
  - Runs on all operating systems
    - Compiled to bytecode that is run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)

# Java Syntax

- Java is yet another C-like programming language
  - Very similar to C++ and C#
- Java has all the core structures:
  - Loops (for, while)
  - Conditionals (if-else, switch)
  - Methods, generic methods
  - Classes, interfaces, abstract
 classes
  - Enumerations

# How Java works?

- Java runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
  - An abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
  - A software package that contains what is required to run a Java program
  - Includes a Java Virtual Machine implementation together with an implementation of the Java Class Library
  - Used by the end users
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
  - A superset of a JRE and contains tools for Java programmers, e.g. a javac compiler.
  - Two implementations available:
    - Official JDK by Oracle (proprietary)
    - OpenJDK (open sourced)

# Setting up Java Environment

1.  Install JDK
  - [link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
2.  Add `/path/to/jkd` to the `PATH`
  - Java should be available in CMD/Terminal
  - Test with `java -version`
3.  Add `JAVA_HOME` system variable

# IDEs for Java

- Java is widely popular and a CLI interface, so it can be coded pretty much anywhere
  - Yet, the most used IDEs are:
    - [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
    - [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
    - [ViM](http://www.vim.org/)
    - [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)
